If you have not picked up your tickets yet please make sure to pick them up by Friday no later than 3 PM.  We are expecting to have the largest turn out this year and are excited that almost all of our employees and their families and friends will be joining us.
			
There are lots of different activities including, baseball, rock climbing, gyro ride, swimming and water slide.  For the younger children we have face painting, balloon animals, arts and crafts booths and much much more!  Sally L., Lucy B. and Violet P. have spent a lot of time organizing all of the events to ensure that everyone will have a great time.  
			
As usual, due to the great response from our previous company picnics we will be offering an all you can eat catered buffet of short ribs, rib eye, filet mignon, roasted chicken, barbeque pork, hot dogs, some dim sum samplings, a bevy of salads and vegetarian dishes and lots more.  We decided to also add shaved ice to the large repertoire of the dessert bar as well.  
			
This year's raffle is filled with wonderful prizes donated by our partners and the grand prize is a first class trip for two to Africa to any 2 cities of your choice as well as an African Safari!   We look forward to spending a fun filled Saturday with our dedicated and hard working employees.
